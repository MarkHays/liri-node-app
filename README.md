# liri-node-app
How to get stared with the app: If someone wanted to clone your app from github and run it themselves, they would need to supply their own `.env` file for it to work.
# Introduction
* I created a node.js app called LIRI. LIRI is like SIRI (from an iphone).

* It must be ran in the command line.

* LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

* LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

* LIRI will do any of the commands below when you enter them into the command line.

1. spotify-this-song
1. movie-this
1. concert-this
1. do-what-it-says

# Next I will add a screenshot for each command.
